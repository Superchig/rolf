# Rolf

> This is _definitely_ a work in progress. Use at your own risk.

`rolf` is a terminal file manager written in Rust. It is mostly inspired by
`lf`, but it is far worse.

## Documentation
Unfortunately, there's no documentation.

Once `rolf` is in a more usable state, I'll actually add something useful.

## TODOs
- [x] Render three panels
- [x] Support super-basic hjkl movement

      an optional dependency.
